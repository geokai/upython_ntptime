assumes device already connected to wifi in the boot.py *add examples*

todo(in order of priority:
    1. add DST/BST functionality
    1. add function to pad zeros
    1. add error catching when the ntptime.settime() fails (often)
    1. improve fonts and display
    1. add a button and timeout so the oled doesn't stay on forever and burn out
