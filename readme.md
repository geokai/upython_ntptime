assumes device already connected to wifi in the boot.py *add examples*

todo(in order of priority:
    add DST/BST functionality
    add function to pad zeros
    add error catching when the ntptime.settime() fails (often)
    improve fonts and display
    add a button and timeout so the oled doesn't stay on forever and burn out
